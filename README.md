# Git Basics Problem Set

### Goals:
- Give you practice using Git to download files from GitHub, edit them, and push them back to the GitHub server.
- Introduce you to the Markdown syntax.

<br />

### Tasks:
1. Skim through [GitHub's Mastering Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Clone this `git-basics-<username>` repository in a terminal on JupyterHub.  Note that your username will be appended to end of the repository name.  If you're not sure how to do this, check out the solution the "Problem Set 0"
1. Create a new file containing two things:
    - Text listing your time zone (e.g., "Eastern" or "GMT-4")
    - A link to `time.is` with your time zone, for example `https://time.is/GMT-4`.
1. Add, Commit, and Push your new file to GitHub.

**Hint:** If you run into issues, you can open this file (README.md) in the text editor and see the markdown used to create the assignment description.
